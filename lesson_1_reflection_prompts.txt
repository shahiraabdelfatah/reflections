How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it is good to use diff betwwen two versions of a file it helps me to see the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Quickly spot and fix bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Doing it manually could mean longer periods between file changes so more to 
	sort through when looking for bugs, but auto saves could mean changes made
	long ago will be harder to find.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is designed for larger projects.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log shows the history and diff compares files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I know I can restore a backup.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
